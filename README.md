# Repository Overview

This repository offers a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with a large language model (LLM) enhanced with a suite of powerful tools. It aims to provide a versatile assistant capable of performing a wide range of tasks with adaptability and self-improvement capabilities.

## Features

- **Planner / Notetaking Application:** Helps organize tasks and thoughts efficiently.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Installer/Manager:** Manages and installs MCP tools, which can be integrated into the model executor for enhanced functionality.
- **Code Interpreter / Python REPL:** Allows execution and testing of Python code snippets within the assistant environment.

## Purpose

The primary goal is to build a JARVIS-like assistant that not only performs diverse tasks but also has the ability to:

- Adjust its own system prompt dynamically.
- Potentially fine-tune itself over time.
- Learn new behaviors and create reusable tools or behaviors for future use.

This design enables continuous learning and improvement, making the assistant more effective and personalized with use.
